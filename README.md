# Gulp Boilerplate

This a simple config for simple sites, or no... :)

## Usage

```shell
yarn start # for production
```

```shell
yarn dev # for development
```

```shell
yarn lint # for fix code with eslint and prettier
```

Edit the files in the 'src' folder. The 'static' folder is the files generated by gulp, so don't modify them!

Note: The 'grid' of project  belongs to Bootstrap 4
